                <p>Hi I’m Wilder, I love woodworking and being outside. If I were a vending machine snack I would want to be Swedish fish and friends, the little turtles are so cute! I am a MechE, and for this project I wanted to develop my fabrication skills to work with new materials, tools, and design more complex parts to tighter tolerances. I also wanted to use design skills to make the project look good visually, help manage the project to be well scoped and functional at the end, and help create a positive teaming experience as well as a project that meets all of our technical expectations.</p>
                <p>I believe I met all of my learning goals, and am very happy with my role in the project and the overall team experience. This project I learned several new manufacturing techniques including TIG welding, sandblasting, angle grinding, horizontal bandsaw, and wood router. I also worked with wood veneer for the first time, which helped the project look very nice visually. Our project functioned well and was complete within the deadline. Most importantly, I had a fantastic teaming experience and I believe I helped foster a supportive, friendly, and productive team environment. </p>

                <p>Hey, I’m Laurel! In my free time, I love channaling my creativity including knitting and playing piano. If I were a snack in the vending machine I would choose popcorn, a reliable choice. I am an ECE student with a software focus. In this project, I developed the interface software in addition to hardware integration. </p>
                <p>My learning goals are to feel more comfortable with circuit design and practice integrating electrical and software components. I also want to improve my collaboration skills when working in a sub-team teaming structure.</p>
                <p>Over the course of this project, I made huge strides in my learning goals. I gained confidence in electrical integration and the confidence in myself to tackle hard projects requiring lots of new knowledge. This teaming experience was phenomenal and I want to bring the clear communication, team health check-ins, and organization to my future teaming experiences. </p>

                <p>My name is Camille! I love trying out new hobbies and learning the histories behind them. If I were a snack in a vending machine, I would want to be a granola bar that no one really wants so that I can people-watch to my heart's delight. Part of the reason I am studying mechanical engineering originated in building cardboard gumball machines, making this project feel full circle.</p>
                <p>I wanted to use this project to help develop my technical and professional skills. I sought to gain a better understanding of machining components and how to integrate firmware, software, and hardware. I also wanted to work on my teaming skills, specifically how I could support the learning of my peers and break down project goals into manageable steps.</p>
                <p>I believe I was able to achieve these learning goals during this project. I spent a lot of time in the shop this semester and was able to get over my fear of shop spaces. I also kept in communication with the electrical team to ensure that my designs also met their design requirements. In the teaming aspect of this project, I think the overall experience was a pleasant one and each subteam constantly had known tasks to tackle. I believe I could’ve supported the learning of my peers more by doing academic check-ins along with health check-ins. Overall this project has taught me a lot about working in teams and my abilities as a mechanical engineer.</p>

                <p>Hi, I’m Tane! I love playing card games and watching cooking videos. If I were a snack in a vending machine, I’d like to be the pack of Sour Patch Kids in the MAC that are hanging by a thread and make you think you’re going to get a free snack every time. I’m studying electrical engineering, and in this project, I worked on building the circuitry and integration. </p>
                <p>My learning goals at the beginning of the project were to get better at integrating different components of the project together by having a cohesive integration plan beforehand, furthering my knowledge of circuit design, and managing the physical realities/dimensions of implementing our circuits. I also wanted to prioritize team health in the project.</p>
                <p>I believe I was able to work on all of my learning goals during this project. During the sprints, I made sure to keep thinking about how to integrate the parts for the next steps, and I also got to tackle more complex circuits and manage different voltage and current requirements. I felt really good about how our team functioned and look forward to future projects!</p>
