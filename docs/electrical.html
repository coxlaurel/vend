    <main>
        <p>The electrical component of the vending machine is responsible for processing signals generated by the user and sending signals and power to the correct motors and lights. The motors connect to the coils that dispense the products and the lights signal to the user when their item is being dispensed.</p>
        <p>The electrical system of the vending machine consists of six 32-step 1/16-gearing stepper motors, four A4988 stepper drivers, an array of LEDs, an AC/DC power adapter, an Arduino, an Arduino motor shield, and a Raspberry Pi 3B+.</p>
        <p>The user interacts with the machine by selecting the item they want dispensed on a touchscreen connected to the Raspberry Pi. This generates a signal that is transmitted to the Arduino through a USB serial connection. The Arduino is connected to the six stepper motors through an Arduino motor shield and four stepper drivers. The drivers and the motor shield both draw power from an outlet through the power adapter to ensure that they’re receiving standard 12V DC. We also used a 100µF bypass capacitor to smooth out the 12V power supply. Our circuit utilizes [XX] Buck converters in order to regulate the voltage that is being fed to the lights and motors.</p>
        <p>[need to write about light sensor for coin when implemented too]</p>
